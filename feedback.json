  "coherence_notes": "The matches are generally justified, but some reasoning for semantic matches, especially regarding API integration and collaboration, could be more robust. The distinctions between match types need clearer definitions.",
  "completeness_notes": "Key JD skills relevant to EDA tools have been overlooked. The candidate's transferable skills were mentioned but not fully explored, particularly how Machine Learning could apply in the context of CAD workflows.",
  "metrics_consistency": "no - match percentage of 7.48 does not correlate well with the high number of unmatched skills and overall fit score of 55, indicating a possible miscalculation.",
  "fairness_notes": "The analysis appears somewhat biased towards the candidate's strengths, downplaying critical gaps such as their complete lack of experience with major EDA tools, which are essential for the role.",
  "suggested_improvements": [
    "Re-evaluate the semantic matches, providing more evidence or alternatives for skills like API integration and teamwork.",
    "Add missing JD skills to the matched or unmatched lists, particularly the critical EDA tools.",
    "Consider recalibrating the overall fit score and match percentage to reflect the high importance of unmatched skills."
